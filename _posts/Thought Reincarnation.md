Reincarnation of a thought revolves around the experience of having an epiphany or a sudden realization, while simultaneously acknowledging the possibility that this thought may have occurred to you before.
The sensation of encountering a thought as if it were new, only to later recognize that you had previously contemplated it.
This can also be described as receiving information in a novel and fresh manner, even though it may have been previously held or known.
