Stand facing east in a quiet place, close your eyes, and take deep breaths to center yourself.  
- Visualize a brilliant white light above your head, symbolizing the divine.  
- Reach up with your right hand and touch your forehead, vibrating the word "Atah" (meaning "Thou art").  
- Lower your hand to touch your solar plexus or genitals, vibrating "Malkuth" (meaning "the Kingdom").  
- Move your hand to your right shoulder and vibrate "ve-Geburah" (meaning "and the Power").  
- Bring your hand across to your left shoulder, vibrating "ve-Gedulah" (meaning "and the Glory").  
- Clasp both hands on your chest and vibrate "le-Olam" (meaning "forever").  
- Conclude by saying "Amen."  
- Envision the cross of light extending from the divine source above through your body and across your shoulders, feeling the energy affirming your connection to the divine.
